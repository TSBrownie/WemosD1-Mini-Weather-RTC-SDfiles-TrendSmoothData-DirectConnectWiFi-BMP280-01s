# WemosD1-Mini-Weather-RTC-SDfiles-TrendSmoothData-DirectConnectWiFi-BMP280-01s
Wemos D1 Mini with RTC-SD card shield. Output to COM and WiFi direct connect. Uses data smoothing to detect trends in pressure and temperature.
I will continue to update the code to the lastest level as I make improvements.
The last release reduced the number of SD card file access routines where possible making it less complex and the compiled code smaller.
